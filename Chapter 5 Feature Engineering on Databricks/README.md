# Chapter 5: Feature Engineering on the Lakehouse

**Here is what you will learn as part of this chapter:**
1. Databrick Feature Engineering (DFE) in Unity Catalog
2. Feature Engineering on a Stream
3. On-Demand Feature Engineering
4. Applying our learning

## Technical requirements 

Here are the technical requirements needed to complete the hands-on examples in this chapter:
- We will create tables in the [Databricks Feature Store](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/feature-store/index.html), a centralized repository of features for machine learning models. 
- We will use the managed [volumes](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-volumes.html) to store the cleaned, featurized data making it ready for machine learning.
