7,How do scholars of law and economics understand the choice between rules and standards?,"Scholars of law and economics understand the choice between rules and standards as a way to allocate costs between lawmakers, law appliers, the subjects of law, and society through social costs. Rules bind a decision-maker to a determinate legal result that follows from the presence of one or more triggering facts, while standards give the decision-maker more discretion and require the application of a background principle or policy to a particularized set of facts to reach a legal conclusion. Rules provide increased clarity and predictability in their application due to their upfront specificity, whereas standards are more vague and, hence, more adaptable to the specific context of a given case.",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
8,What is the difference between rules and standards in terms of clarity and predictability in their application?,"Rules establish their normative content in advance, while standards determine theirs, at least partially, after the fact. Opting for standards over rules consequently shifts decision-making authority from the lawmaker to the law applier. Rules tend to be advantageous when the behavior they govern is frequent and homogenous, while standards may be preferable for infrequent and heterogeneous behavior. Standards may not necessarily have lower error costs when compared to rules, as behavioral considerations and hindsight bias can affect decision-makers' ability to properly apply standards. In practice, the choice between rules and standards frequently falls on a continuum between the extremes of pure rules and pure standards, and decision-makers may adapt rules to be more like standards and vice versa.",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
9,How does the choice between rules and standards impact decision-making authority in law?,"The choice between rules and standards impacts decision-making authority in law by determining the level of discretion given to the decision-maker. Rules bind the decision-maker to a determinate legal result, while standards require the application of a background principle or policy to a particularized set of facts, giving the decision-maker more discretion.",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
10,What are the different types of costs associated with rules and standards in law and economics?,"The different types of costs associated with rules and standards in law and economics include up-front decision costs, error costs, and uncertainty costs. Rules tend to have higher up-front decision costs for the lawmaker, but can reduce error costs by providing clarity and predictability. Standards have lower up-front decision costs, but can have higher error costs due to their vagueness and may also have higher uncertainty costs for those subject to the law.",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
11,How do rules and standards impact error costs in law and economics?,"The choice between rules and standards can impact error costs in law and economics. Rules, with their upfront specificity, can reduce error costs by providing clarity and predictability, but can also increase error costs if they are over- or under-inclusive. Standards, on the other hand, can have higher error costs due to their vagueness and the need for discretion in their application, but can also reduce error costs by being more adaptable to the specific context of a given case.",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
12,How does the choice between rules and standards impact upfront decision costs for lawmakers?,"The choice between rules and standards impacts upfront decision costs for lawmakers because rules require more specificity and detail in their formulation, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive to create. Standards, on the other hand, are more vague and provide decision-makers with more discretion, which can result in lower upfront decision costs for lawmakers.",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
13,How do rules and standards impact behavioural considerations in law and economics?,"Behavioural considerations can impact the choice between rules and standards in law and economics. For example, decision-makers may be more likely to comply with rules due to the certainty and clarity they provide, but standards may lead to better outcomes in complex or dynamic situations where discretion is needed.",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
14,How does the choice between rules and standards impact decision costs for law appliers?,"Rules can provide clear guidance and reduce uncertainty, which can lower decision costs for law appliers. However, standards can be more flexible and adaptable to the specific context of a given case, which can also reduce decision costs for law appliers. It is important to note that the choice between rules and standards is not always clear-cut, and the optimal choice may depend on the specific context and factors at play. Additionally, in practice, the distinction between rules and standards can often be blurred, as decision-makers may adapt rules to be more like standards and vice versa",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
15,How does the choice between rules and standards impact the subjects of law and society through social costs?,"Rules are more costly to create and update, but they provide increased clarity and predictability in their application, which can reduce error costs for law appliers. Standards, on the other hand, are less costly to create and update but provide more flexibility in their application, which can increase error costs for law appliers. The choice between rules and standards can also impact the allocation of decision-making authority between lawmakers and law appliers, with rules shifting decision-making authority to law appliers and standards shifting decision-making authority to lawmakers.",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
16,How does the choice between rules and standards impact content moderation on social media platforms?,"Rules can provide clear guidelines for content moderators to follow, reducing the need for human involvement and potentially lowering error costs. However, rules may not be effective in addressing complex or dynamic issues, such as hate speech, and may require frequent updates to remain effective. Standards, on the other hand, can provide flexibility for content moderators to adjust their policies to specific contexts, but may require more human involvement and potentially increase error costs due to the complexity of the moderation task.",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2312/2312.14565.pdf,The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers
17,What are large language models (LLMs) and how do they differ from other generative AI models?,"Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence models that can process and produce various forms of sequential data, including but not limited to natural language. They differ from other generative AI models as they can be trained using a range of architectures and are not limited to transformer-based models. LLMs can generate a wide range of sequences, such as assembly language, protein sequences, and chess games.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf,GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models
